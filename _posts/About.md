Nothing is more remarkable than the ability to express oneself. As painters, we might use a blank canvas to create something spectacular, or we might imagine our computer programmes as digital canvases. After approaching the art of coding, I realised how strong the relationship between the two can be, programming is an extremely creative profession, itâ€™s logic-based creativity. It requires shaping code into works of art that can stand the test of time. As a result, I am certain that technology and art have been partners from the beginning, and I am grateful to be able to mix them both.
