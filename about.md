**I've been a visual artist since elementary
school. Earlier this year, I became really
interested in learning about and developing
applications and websites, with a focus on
combining my creative background with
responsive web designs.**


**I enrolled at The Coders Guild's JAMStack Bootcamp in late May. Now I am comfortable dealing with:**
- HTML5, CSS3
- Bootstrap
- JavaScript and Jquery
- Netlify CMS
- Adobe Photoshop CC
- Git / Github
